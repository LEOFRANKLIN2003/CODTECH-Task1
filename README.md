## Overview of the Project

### Project: House Price Prediction Web Application Using Linear Regression

### Overview:
This repository contains a Flask web application for predicting house prices using a linear regression model. The model is trained on the Boston Housing dataset and allows users to input various features of a house to get a predicted price.

### Features

  1.Model Training: Utilizes the Boston Housing dataset to train a linear regression model.
  
  2.Web Interface: A user-friendly web interface built with Flask, allowing users to input house features and get predictions.
  
  3.Model Evaluation: The application evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.

### Usage

  1.Run the application
  
  2.Access the web application
  
    Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
    
  3.Predict House Prices:
    
    Fill in the house features on the home page.
    
    Submit the form to get the predicted house price.

### File Structure

  1.app.py: Main application file containing the Flask routes and model logic.
  
  2.templates/: Folder containing HTML templates (index.html for input form, result.html for displaying prediction).
  
  3.Boston_House.csv: Dataset file

### Model Details:

  1.Features: All columns except MEDV are used as features.
  
  2.Target: MEDV (Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s).
  
  3.Model: Linear Regression.
  
  4.Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) metrics.
